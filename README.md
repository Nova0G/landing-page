Odin Landing Page From Scratch Project

This project is a Landing Page coded from scratch. I was given an image to work from and was given a few design parameters like color, font and font size etc. I used images I found, but used the text given in the Design Image. Overall a fun project where I got to show my skills with Vanilla CSS and HTML.

<!-- 1: Update page with my own text and links  -->
<!-- 2: Add comments to CSS file -->
<!-- 3: Tidy up and fix minor details I missed -->

<!-- Looking back I realize now that I could've combined some selectors in the css file to save time and css lines coded. Apply DRY principle -->
